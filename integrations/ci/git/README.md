# Source Control with Git

One of the most powerful features of Datafold is our ability to integrate with your source control system and display potential data issues before changes are made. Pull requests with Datafold now alert when there are downstream changes or unintended data issues coming through.&#x20;

Presently, you can set up continuous integration with:

{% content-ref url="github/" %}
[github](github/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="gitlab.md" %}
[gitlab.md](gitlab.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
