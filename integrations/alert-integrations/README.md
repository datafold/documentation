# Alert Integrations

Datafold alerts are easy to set up through our UI and allow for fully custom alerts based on SQL queries. Specify the frequency of your alerts and the communication channel to monitor your data.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
SQL queries should be written to analyze a time series.
{% endhint %}
