# Slack Alerts

You can configure the alert notifications to be sent to designated public or private Slack channels with an option to mention specific users. All public channels will automatically be available for reports:

You have to invite the Datafold bot into that channel for private channels by mentioning it as `@datafold` in the channel of interest. Within 5 minutes, the private channel will be included in the list of available channels. Otherwise, the channel will not be visible to Datafold.

To hide the private channel from the bot, remove the bot from the channel. The application will notice the change within 5 minutes.
