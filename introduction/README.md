description: Setting up Pro-Active Data Quality using Datafold
---

# Introduction

Getting started with Datafold is accommodated in three parts:

* ****[**Data Diff**](data-diff/) makes sure that you're in control of the changes to the data pipeline. Don't get fooled by an erroneous transformation, or an unexpected change downstream.
* [**Data catalog with column-level lineage**](column-level-lineage/) gives detailed insight into how the data streams throughout the pipeline, and where reports source their data from.
* ****[**Alerting**](alerting.md) makes sure that you get notified when something unexpected happens with the data that you base your business-critical decisions on.

The getting started guides are based on [Datafolds' public dbt-beers](https://github.com/datafold/dbt-beers) repository.
