This sections describes setting up a data source within Datafold. This is set up in 3 sections:

* **Indexing** The process of ingesting the schema from the data warehouse
* **Profiling** The process of computing statistics (number of rows, percentage of nulls, histograms etc) of the tables
* **Lineage** The process of fetching the historical SQL statements, which are parsed by Datafold, in order to resolve lineage&#x20;
