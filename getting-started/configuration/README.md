# Configuration

After setting up a data source, Datafold allows you to set unique configurations for all of our tooling. This is set up in 4 sections:

* ****[**Indexing**](indexing.md) **** The process of ingesting the schema from the data warehouse
* [**Filtering**](filtering.md) Limiting which datasets and tables are used in Datafold
* ****[**Profiling** ](profiling.md)The process of computing statistics (number of rows, percentage of nulls, histograms etc) of the tables
* ****[**Lineage**](lineage.md) **** The process of fetching the historical SQL statements, which are parsed by Datafold, in order to resolve lineage&#x20;
